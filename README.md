# data_usage
Works on both Windows and Linux. Time interval input should be in seconds to make scheduling easier. Script runs every x seconds until its broken out of or the program is terminated. Depending on the specs of pc that runs the script, there may be some drifting in time (around a second). User should enter full path to the file when starting script.  In the resulting csv file, each instance of running the script is separated in order to make it easier to find info. Print statements are commented out since displaying the stats wasnt required.
